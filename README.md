# JobBoard.OS

A premium, dark-themed job board built with Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS v4, and Shadcn/UI. Features glassmorphism cards, brand-gradient company logos, real-time debounced search, URL-synced filters, a blurred side-drawer job detail view, staggered animations, skeleton loaders, and a full apply flow with localStorage persistence and toast notifications.

**Live demo:** https://job-board-os.vercel.app

## Design Decisions

### Dark Theme & Glassmorphism

The application uses a permanent deep off-black (`#0A0A0A`) base - not pure black, which looks harsh, and not `zinc-950`, which is too blue-tinted. Against this base, all interactive surfaces (cards, filter bar, side drawer) use `bg-white/[0.02]–bg-white/[0.08]` with `border-white/[0.05]–border-white/[0.1]` - a glassmorphism technique that creates physical depth without heavy shadows.

The sticky filter bar uses `backdrop-blur-xl` so it reads as a frosted-glass panel floating above the job list. The side-drawer overlay uses `bg-black/60 backdrop-blur-sm` - blurring the content behind the sheet satisfies the assignment's "subtle blurs" requirement while keeping the drawer panel itself crisp and readable.

### The Background Gradient

A single `radial-gradient(ellipse 80% 50% at 50% -20%, rgba(120,119,198,0.3), rgba(255,255,255,0))` is applied directly as the page background, creating a soft purple/indigo spotlight that bleeds down from the top of the viewport. This satisfies the "gradients" requirement without any linear text-gradients or button gradients, which tend to look cheap. The gradient is visible, not merely hinted at.

### Brand-Gradient Company Logos

Company logos are white SVGs sourced from the Simple Icons CDN (`cdn.simpleicons.org/{slug}/ffffff`). Each logo sits on a brand-specific `bg-gradient-to-br` tile - Linear gets `indigo → violet`, Stripe gets `indigo → cyan`, Loom gets `orange → red`, Figma gets `orange → violet`, and so on. A `shadow-[0_0_16px_rgba(255,255,255,0.08)]` halo gives each tile a soft ambient glow. Unknown companies receive a deterministic gradient from an 8-colour fallback palette. If the CDN fetch fails, a `LetterAvatar` with a matching tinted dark palette is rendered instead.

### Colourful Tinted Badges

Every job attribute badge carries a semantic colour:

| Label | Colour |
|---|---|
| Full-time | Blue |
| Contract | Amber |
| Engineering | Violet |
| Design | Pink |
| Marketing | Emerald |
| Remote | Cyan |
| London | Orange |
| NYC | Rose |

This lets users scan the list visually - a glance at the badge colours is enough to understand the role at a distance without reading every word.

### Typography

Geist Sans (400–700) is used throughout. It is the typeface designed by Vercel for developer-facing interfaces: geometric, legible at small sizes, with excellent tabular numerals for salary figures. `tracking-tight` on all headings sharpens the premium feel.

### Centered Modal for Job Details

The job detail view uses a centered Dialog built directly on `@base-ui/react/dialog` primitives rather than a side sheet. The backdrop uses `bg-black/80 backdrop-blur-sm` - a heavy dim that keeps focus entirely on the modal content. The popup is `max-w-2xl` with `max-h-[88vh]` and a three-zone flex layout: a fixed header (logo, title, bento metadata, badges), a `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` body for the full role description, and a sticky footer with the single Apply CTA that is always reachable regardless of scroll depth. An `X` button at `top-4 right-4` handles dismissal; the Esc key and backdrop click close the dialog automatically via base-ui's built-in behaviour.

## Architecture

The project follows **Atomic Design**, organising components from smallest primitive to full page section.

```
components/
├── atoms/            Stateless building blocks
│   ├── CompanyLogo     Brand-gradient tile + img with LetterAvatar fallback
│   ├── JobBadge        Colour-coded pill for type / dept / location
│   └── LetterAvatar    Dark-palette letter avatar for failed/missing logos
│
├── molecules/        Compositions of atoms with localised state
│   ├── JobCard         Glassmorphism card - logo, badges, metadata, hover arrow
│   ├── JobCardSkeleton Shadcn Skeleton mirroring the card layout
│   ├── FilterBar       2-row sticky bar: search (row 1) + filter chips (row 2)
│   └── EmptyState      "No roles found" with reset affordance
│
└── organisms/        Page-level sections that own or consume shared state
    ├── Hero            Compact dark heading with status badge
    ├── JobGrid         AnimatePresence list - skeletons → cards → empty state
    ├── JobDetailSheet  Shadcn Sheet with bento metadata + sticky Apply CTA
    └── JobBoard        Client orchestrator - wires all hooks to all UI
```

### Data & State Flow

```
app/page.tsx  (Server Component)
  └── <Suspense fallback={<FallbackGrid />}>
        └── <JobBoard>  (Client Component)
              ├── useJobs()           ← URL-synced search/type/dept filters
              │     └── useDebounce() ← 300 ms delay on search input
              ├── useAppliedJobs()    ← localStorage applied IDs set
              ├── [showAppliedOnly]   ← local boolean state
              ├── <Hero />
              ├── <FilterBar />       ← controlled inputs + Applied toggle chip
              ├── <JobGrid />         ← filtered + applied-only list
              └── <JobDetailSheet />  ← opened on card click
```

**`useJobs`** - single source of truth for search and filter state. Reads initial values from URL search params on mount (`useSearchParams`), filters the `jobs.json` array in memory, and reflects every change back to the URL via `router.replace` (shallow, no page reload). This makes any filtered view shareable by copying the address bar.

**`useDebounce`** - generic hook (`useDebounce<T>(value, delay)`) that delays propagating a value until 300 ms after the last change. The raw `searchQuery` is bound to the input immediately for a responsive feel; the `debouncedQuery` drives the actual filter logic.

**`useAppliedJobs`** - reads and writes a `Set<string>` of applied job IDs to `localStorage` under the key `"jobboard_applied_ids"`. Survives page refreshes. Exposes `applyToJob(id)` and `isApplied(id)`.

- **Filter by Type** - "All / Full-time / Contract" pill group; active pill uses tinted glass highlight
- **Filter by Department** - exposed as a horizontal pill row; active pill uses `bg-white text-black` with a soft white glow for instant visual feedback

- **Responsive** - single-column mobile; filter pill row wraps on small screens; dialog is full-width on mobile
- **Real-time debounced search** - 300 ms delay, URL-synced (`?q=`)
- **URL-synced filters** - `?type=Full-time&dept=Engineering` is restorable and shareable
- **Skeleton loaders** - Shadcn Skeleton cards rendered during the simulated 700 ms load
- **Staggered entry animations** - Framer Motion `AnimatePresence` with 40 ms per-card stagger
- **Apply flow** - 1 s simulated network request → Sonner toast → `localStorage` persistence → card badge + disabled sheet state across page refreshes
- **"Show Applied" filter** - chip in the filter bar shows count badge; emerald glow when active
- **Empty state** - illustrated with a reset button that clears all filter state and URL params
- **Keyboard navigation** - all cards `tabIndex={0}` with Enter/Space handlers; Esc closes the drawer; `aria-pressed` on pills; `role="switch"` on the Applied toggle
- **Letter Avatar fallback** - dark-palette tinted avatars when logo CDN fails; deterministic colour by company name
